# Educational Textbook Creation Standards

## Pedagogical Frameworks

### Bloom's Taxonomy Application
- Knowledge/Remembering: Recall facts, terms, basic concepts
- Comprehension/Understanding: Explain ideas, interpret information
- Application: Use information in new situations
- Analysis: Draw connections, compare/contrast
- Evaluation: Justify decisions, critique information
- Creation: Generate new ideas, design solutions

### ADDIE Model for Textbook Development
- **Analysis**: Identify learner needs, subject requirements
- **Design**: Create learning objectives, content structure
- **Development**: Create actual content, exercises
- **Implementation**: Pilot testing, feedback collection
- **Evaluation**: Revise based on assessment data

### Universal Design for Learning (UDL) Principles
- **Multiple Means of Engagement**: Provide different ways to motivate
- **Multiple Means of Representation**: Present information in various formats
- **Multiple Means of Action & Expression**: Allow different ways to demonstrate learning

## Accessibility Guidelines

### WCAG 2.1 for Educational Content
- **Perceivable**: Text alternatives, captions, adaptable content
- **Operable**: Keyboard navigation, sufficient time, clear navigation
- **Understandable**: Readable text, predictable behavior
- **Robust**: Compatible with assistive technologies

### Textbook-Specific Accessibility
- Alternative text for all images and diagrams
- Structured headings and logical reading order
- Color contrast ratios (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Adjustable font sizes and line spacing
- Screen reader compatibility
- Keyboard-accessible interactive elements

## Content Structure Standards

### Learning Objectives Framework
- **SMART Objectives**: Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound
- **Cognitive Domain**: Knowledge, Comprehension, Application, Analysis, Synthesis, Evaluation
- **Affective Domain**: Receiving, Responding, Valuing, Organization, Characterization
- **Psychomotor Domain**: Imitation, Manipulation, Precision, Articulation, Naturalization

### Chapter Organization
1. **Introduction**: Overview, learning objectives, prerequisites
2. **Main Content**: Theory, examples, applications
3. **Activities**: Practice exercises, problem-solving
4. **Assessment**: Self-check questions, quizzes
5. **Summary**: Key points, review questions
6. **Resources**: Further reading, additional materials
