# Document Processing Guidelines

## Analysis Framework

### Phase Detection
1. **Content Segmentation**: Break document into logical sections
2. **Thematic Analysis**: Identify distinct themes and topics
3. **Sequence Recognition**: Determine natural order of phases
4. **Dependency Mapping**: Identify relationships between sections

### Content Extraction
1. **Principle Identification**: Extract guiding principles and goals
2. **Requirement Gathering**: Identify specific requirements and constraints
3. **Process Mapping**: Outline workflows and procedures
4. **Quality Standards**: Extract quality criteria and success metrics

## Transformation Rules

### From Document to Structure
- **Section → Phase**: Each major section becomes a phase
- **Paragraph → Content**: Content becomes detailed specifications
- **List → Checklist**: Items become actionable steps
- **Heading → Section**: Structure defines organization

### Quality Enhancement
1. **Clarity**: Rewrite ambiguous content for clarity
2. **Completeness**: Fill in missing logical connections
3. **Consistency**: Standardize terminology and formatting
4. **Actionability**: Convert passive descriptions to active instructions

## Naming Convention Rules

### File Naming
- **Global Files**: Use descriptive names (constitution.md, claude.md)
- **Phase Specs**: Use sequential numbering (spec-1.md, spec-2.md)
- **Roadmap**: Use clear descriptive names (steps.md)

### Section Naming
- **Phases**: Use descriptive, action-oriented names
- **Sections**: Follow consistent heading hierarchy
- **Checklists**: Use clear, actionable item names

## Validation Patterns

### Completeness Checks
- [ ] All phases from document are represented
- [ ] All key principles are captured
- [ ] All requirements are documented
- [ ] All processes are outlined

### Consistency Checks
- [ ] Terminology is consistent across files
- [ ] Formatting follows established patterns
- [ ] Dependencies are clearly documented
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable

### Quality Checks
- [ ] Content is clear and actionable
- [ ] Instructions are complete and logical
- [ ] Standards are well-defined and achievable
- [ ] Roadmap provides clear guidance
