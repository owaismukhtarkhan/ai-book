# Quality Assurance Guidelines

## Implementation Standards

### File Structure Requirements
- All generated files must follow the specified naming conventions
- Directory structure must be logical and consistent
- File content must be complete and well-organized
- Cross-references between files must be accurate

### Content Quality Standards
- **Clarity**: All instructions must be clear and unambiguous
- **Completeness**: All required sections must be present and filled
- **Consistency**: Terminology and formatting must be uniform
- **Actionability**: Instructions must be specific and executable

## Validation Checklist

### Global Files Validation
- [ ] constitution.md contains vision, principles, and rules
- [ ] claude.md contains technical instructions and coding standards
- [ ] Both files follow the specified templates
- [ ] Content is coherent and well-structured

### Phase Specifications Validation
- [ ] Each spec file follows the standard structure
- [ ] All phases from the source document are represented
- [ ] Objectives and deliverables are clearly defined
- [ ] Dependencies and prerequisites are documented
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable

### Roadmap Validation
- [ ] steps.md contains all phases in logical order
- [ ] Each step is clear and actionable
- [ ] Dependencies between steps are explicit
- [ ] Checklist format is consistent and complete

## Error Handling

### Common Issues
1. **Missing Content**: Identify and fill gaps in the source document
2. **Ambiguous Instructions**: Clarify vague or unclear requirements
3. **Inconsistent Terminology**: Standardize language across all files
4. **Logical Gaps**: Ensure proper flow and dependencies

### Resolution Process
1. Analyze the issue and its impact
2. Determine the appropriate fix
3. Implement the correction
4. Validate the fix meets quality standards
5. Update all affected files

## Testing and Verification

### Automated Checks
- File existence and naming
- Template compliance
- Cross-reference validation
- Dependency mapping

### Manual Review
- Content clarity and coherence
- Logical flow and organization
- Completeness of requirements
- Actionability of instructions

## Continuous Improvement

### Feedback Integration
- Gather user feedback on generated structures
- Identify common issues and patterns
- Refine templates and guidelines
- Update validation criteria

### Quality Metrics
- Completion rate of generated structures
- User satisfaction with outputs
- Time to implement generated roadmaps
- Error rate in generated files
